## Interest Calculator

This ***Java Program*** creates an [Interest Calculator](./assets/javaCode/Interest.java) to calculate either a simple, compound, or continious interest. This program requires a [Driver program](./assets/javaCode/Interest.java) to run it. It displays a GUI to obtain the input from the user then outputs the results into an output file.
