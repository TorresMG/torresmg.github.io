## Interest Calculator

This ***Java Program*** creates an [Interest Calculator](./assets/javaCode/Interest.java) to calculate either a simple, compound, or continious interest. This program requires a [Driver program](./assets/javaCode/Interest.java) to run it. It displays a GUI to obtain the input from the user then outputs the results into an output file.

This ***C++ Program*** obtains information from the user such as the number of shapes, the number of sides of each shapes, and the side lengths and uses them to calculate what is requested. There is also an updated version of this program that utlizes ***linked lists** to store the shape objects. The linked lists can also be modified to insert or delete a shape object if called to.
